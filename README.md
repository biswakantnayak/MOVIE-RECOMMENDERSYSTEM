# MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

## Objective:
**Developed a `Movie Recommender System` using open-source MovieLens data to recommend movies to users based on `popularity-based recommender system`, `content-based recommender system`, and `collaborative based recommender system`.**

## Tools & Libraries
- **Tools:** Python & Jupyter notebook
- **Libraries:** pandas, ipywidgets, IPython & warnings 

## Problem Statement
1. Import libraries and load dataset 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis including: 
    - Understanding of distribution of the features available 
    - Finding unique users and movies 
    - Average rating and Total movies at genre level. 
    - Unique genres considered.. 
3. Design the 3 different types of recommendation modules as mentioned in the objectives. 
4. Additional/Optional: Create a GUI interface using Python libraries (ipywidgets etc.) to play around with the recommendation modules.

## Process:
1. Data Loaded & EDA(Distribution of features, Unique genres, users, movies)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Building 3 different types of recommendation modules as:
   - Popularity-based recommender system
   - Content-based recommender system
   - Collaborative based recommender system
4. Final Evaluation:
    - Ranking of Movies based on model.
    - GUI interface.

## Key Features
- Built 3 recommenders: **Popularity-based**, **Content-based**, and **Collaborative Filtering**
- Enabled **genre-based filtering** with rating thresholds
- Used **basic pandas operations** 
- Developed a clean, modular, and easy-to-read codebase
- Created a simple, interactive UI using **`ipywidgets`**

## Outcome:
**Deploying a versatile `Movie recommendation system` for the OTT domain with multiple techniques for offering personalized suggestions through multiple recommendation system to multiple user.**
